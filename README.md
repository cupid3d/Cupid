<p align="center"><strong>Results for pose-grounded <em>generative 3D reconstruction</em> from a single test image.</strong> Given an input image (top left), CUPID estimates camera pose (bottom left) and reconstructs a 3D model (bottom right), re-rendering the input (top right). It is robust to changes in scale, placement, and lighting while preserving fine texture, and supports component-aligned scene reconstruction (bottom row). All results are produced in seconds via feed-forward sampling of the learned model. See <a href="https://cupid3d.github.io/#sec:interactive_demo">cupid3d.github.io</a> for an immersive view of the interactive 3D results.</p>
